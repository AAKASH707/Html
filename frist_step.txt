A markup language is a set of markup tags.These tags are used to describe web pages. So, we can say that HTML is a collection
of tags to design the layout and hyperlinks of web pages.

Programming langusges are written to process data and perform different tasks on a computer. HTML doesn't really process data or perform 
tasks like a programming language.
